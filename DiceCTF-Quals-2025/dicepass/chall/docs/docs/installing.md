# Setting up dicepass  

## Getting Started  

To set up **dicepass**, follow these steps:  

1. Click the **Extensions** button next to the address bar (it looks like a puzzle piece).  
2. In the list of installed extensions, locate **dicepass** and click the **pin** icon to keep it easily accessible.  
3. Once pinned, click the **dicepass** logo next to the Extensions button to activate it.  

## Setting Your Master Password  

After installing **dicepass**, you’ll need to create a **master password**.  

- The master password encrypts and secures all of your stored credentials.  
- If you lose it, your stored passwords cannot be recovered, so choose something secure and memorable.  

To create your master password:  

1. Click the **dicepass** button to open the extension.  
2. In the password field that appears, enter a strong master password.  
3. Click **Create** to confirm.  

Once set up, you’ll be directed to the **dicepass** main page. If you log out (either manually or by restarting your browser), you will need to re-enter your master password to regain access.
