# Using dicepass  

## The dicepass Popup  

Once you‚Äôre logged into **dicepass**, clicking the **dicepass** extension icon will open the main page.  

The main page provides:  
1. A list of all stored websites and usernames in your vault.  
2. A form to add a new username and password.  
3. Options to log out or clear your stored data.  

### Managing Entries  

- To delete an entry, click the **üóëÔ∏è** icon next to it.  
- To view a stored password, click the masked `********` text under the password column, then re-enter your **master password**.  
  - This extra step ensures your passwords remain secure.  

## dicepass Autofill  

**dicepass** can automatically fill in your saved credentials on supported websites.  

### How It Works  

1. If you are logged into **dicepass** and visit a website with a login form, the **dicepass** logo will appear in the upper-right corner of the page.  
2. Clicking the logo will autofill your credentials if they are saved in your vault.  

### Saving New Credentials  

- If you enter a username and password manually, clicking the **dicepass** logo will prompt you to save the credentials for future use.  

### Undoing Autofill  

- If **dicepass** overwrites text in a login form by mistake, simply click the logo again to restore your original input.
