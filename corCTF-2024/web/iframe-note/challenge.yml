  i'm sick of all those note taking web apps that just take text. iframes are the future

  +24 hour hint drop: did you think this was just a client side challenge? why don't you take a closer look at the server code?

  +36 hour hint drop: the intended solution does not get XSS via the iframe src sink (as in, the http check is not bypassed). theres a reason i made the chall in pythonâ€¦
