Description:
```
Yet another Chrome extension web challenge... wait, the extension is on the Chrome Web Store??

hint 1: wow, that's such a weird way to parse stylesheets, huh?

hint 2: this site is #amazing and #great

hint 3: why don't you guys #focus more on this challenge?

NOTE: the admin bot isn't logged into any account, but it can do requests to the localhost instance at `http://localhost`, giving the admin bot admin access
